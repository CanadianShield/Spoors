# 🐾 S01E02 - The post-person

The message's first stop was the Exchange Online environment of Piesec Corp. In this first season os Spoors, we will not focus on the Exchange Online Protection features or the Microsoft Defender for Office features. So this is somewhat a special episode as in this one, we will look at some of the advanced hunting tables available in the [Defender 365 portal](https://security.microsoft.com). 

The investigation could have started from different angles. Here are some examples:

1. The user reported the email. So we start with the `Message-ID` (the default reporting options are allowing the user the report the message as a Phishing attempt. Which the message is not, but at least it would bring awareness of the email to the administrators). 
2. We could have spotted weird things being created from an Excel file `Ahah-Macro.xlsm` and look for mail attachment containing the name or the hash of that file.

If we have the identifier of the message we can look for it in the Advanced Audit logs in the compliance center, from the OfficeActivity table in Sentinel or the activity section in MCAS if it was configured to get the Exchange Online activity.



## 🔎 We have the message id can we tell if there was an attachment?

Yes. Something along these lines:

```
EmailEvents
| where InternetMessageId == "<CB2JGuLmZuoy2POL9MECf_KLtKDZWrOKHay-yHd5IMy4k6rN_Fu1K-UgMw3QqwlgvUOQucPivQiww86AjmPXl6xgbbL681C98rFPMJU3qbw=@protonmail.com>"
| join kind=leftouter (
    EmailAttachmentInfo
) on NetworkMessageId
| project Timestamp, SenderFromAddress, RecipientEmailAddress, DeliveryAction, DeliveryLocation, FileName, FileSize, SHA256
```

Will return:

|Timestamp|SenderFromAddress|RecipientEmailAddress|Subject|DeliveryAction|DeliveryLocation|FileName|FileSize|SHA256|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Oct 24, 2021 9:36:58 PM|piaudonn@protonmail.com|verena@piesec.ca|🎯 Will you open it pretttttty please?|Delivered|Inbox/folder|Ahah-Macro.xlsm|14321|6a45af8da733df25c8625caa983d9c6e60b197b701ab5b369d30f596cf394ca4|


## 📁 We have the file name, can we tell if it was received by email?

If we have the name `Ahah-Macro.xlsmAhah-Macro.xlsm` or the SHA256 hash `6a45af8da733df25c8625caa983d9c6e60b197b701ab5b369d30f596cf394ca4` we can check where it got delivered with:

```
EmailAttachmentInfo
| where FileName =~ "Ahah-Macro.xlsm" or SHA256 == "6a45af8da733df25c8625caa983d9c6e60b197b701ab5b369d30f596cf394ca4"
| join kind=leftouter (
    EmailEvents
) on NetworkMessageId
| project Timestamp, SenderFromAddress, RecipientEmailAddress, Subject, DeliveryAction, DeliveryLocation, FileName, FileSize, SHA256
```

Will return:

|Timestamp|SenderFromAddress|RecipientEmailAddress|Subject|DeliveryAction|DeliveryLocation|FileName|FileSize|SHA256|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Oct 24, 2021 9:37:29 PM|piaudonn@protonmail.com|bob@piesec.ca|🎯 Will you open it pretttttty please?|Delivered|Inbox/folder|Ahah-Macro2.xlsm|14321|6a45af8da733df25c8625caa983d9c6e60b197b701ab5b369d30f596cf394ca4|
|Oct 24, 2021 9:36:58 PM|piaudonn@protonmail.com|verena@piesec.ca|🎯 Will you open it please?|Delivered|Inbox/folder|Ahah-Macro.xlsm|14321|6a45af8da733df25c8625caa983d9c6e60b197b701ab5b369d30f596cf394ca4|

We can see that bob too has received the message. And we can also see that although the file name is different (`Ahah-Macro2.xlsm` instead of `Ahah-Macro.xlsm`) the hash is the same.


## ❓ Who read the message?

We can see at least two recipients received the message. But have they read it? The next request is querying the OfficeActivity from Microsoft Sentinel to determine if the mail was opened. 

```
OfficeActivity
| where Folders contains "<CB2JGuLmZuoy2POL9MECf_KLtKDZWrOKHay-yHd5IMy4k6rN_Fu1K-UgMw3QqwlgvUOQucPivQiww86AjmPXl6xgbbL681C98rFPMJU3qbw=@protonmail.com>"
| project TimeGenerated, Operation, UserId, MailboxGuid
```

Will return:

|TimeGenerated|Operation|Operation|UserId|MailboxGuid|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|10/25/2021, 3:40:03.000 AM|MailItemsAccessed|verena@piesec.ca|d71c21e3-7351-4374-8112-f0b355316a5b|

So we can see that Verena has seen the message. And that Bob has not. We can't know if the attachement was downloaded in our case.

If we have eyes on the devices, we could see the file being written on the disk. 
Interresting fact, with the Outlook client it seems that the attachement get written on the disk even if the user doesn't click save. When the user select the attachement and click and see this:

![attachment warning](/Images/S01E02-01.png)

The file is written on the disk in the path defined here: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Security\OutlookSecureTempFolder` which by default seems to be the following path: `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\Content.Outlook\<SOME RANDOM STRING>\`.

## Appendix - ❓ Where was the message from?
