# 🐾 S01E06 - Registry tracks

The registry modification was done in PowerShell through the `Invoke-WmiMethod`:
```
Invoke-WmiMethod -Class StdRegProv -Name SetStringValue -ArgumentList (2147483649,"SOFTWARE","Yes","CanBeDeleted")
```
So it will create a registry string value `CanDeDeleted` set to `Yes` under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE`. Here is mapping table for the hive numbers used in the method:

|Hive|Hexadecimal value|Decimal value|
|--|--|--|
|`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT`|`0x80000000`|`2147483648`|
|`HKEY_CURRENT_USER`|`0x80000001`|`2147483649`|
|`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`|`0x80000002`|`2147483650`|
|`HKEY_USERS`|`0x80000003`|`2147483651`|
|`HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA`|`0x80000004`|`2147483652`|
|`HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG`|`0x80000005`|`2147483653`|
|`HKEY_DYN_DATA`|`0x80000006`|`2147483654`|

What do we see from this in the local system?

## ❓ What is there by default?

Again, nothing. But like other operating system, the right combination of Advanced Audit Policy and SCAL will generate traces in the `Security` event log. 

The `Registry` audit subcategory needs to be enabled:
```
auditpol /get /subcategory:"Registry"
System audit policy
Category/Subcategory                      Setting
Object Access
  Registry                                Success and Failure
```
And SACL needs to be set on the registry object. Then a modification will generate the event `4657`:

![4657](/Images/S01E06-01.png)

Note that since the registry modification was done through the `StdRegProv` WMI provider, the process name noted for this event is `WmiPrvSE.exe`. 

That's pretty much all we have out of the box and since we can't practically enabled SACL for modification everywhere, we have to be selective or be ready to handle a flooding of `4657`.

## 🙏 Sysmon to the rescue!

Sysmon and a good configuration file (such as the one suggested by [SwiftOnSecurity](https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config/blob/master/sysmonconfig-export.xml)) will help us with bringing a good balance between noise and threat detection. It would not have helped us for our macro because it is writing in a harmless place, but if the macro did try to write somewhere fishy, then Sysmon would have generate an event `13`.

Just for the sake, if we had configured Sysmon to track modification under the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE`, this is what we would have seen in the `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` event log:

![13](/Images/S01E06-02.png)

## 🙈 What if we don't have anything in the log?

Registry keys have metadata which are not visible with the regular tools (such as `regedit.exe`). Each key is storing a timestamp of last write time. It is at the key level, not at the value level. So if there are multiple values in a key, the timestamp will not tell us which value was last change. But we would know that something has changed.

To see those timestamps, you can select a key in `regedit` and chose to export it in a **text format**.
![Regedit export](/Images/S01E06-03.png)
Then the timestamp will show up at the key level:
![exported](/Images/S01E06-04.png)

So if we have traces of processes that are known to be able to modify the registry such as:
- `reg.exe`
- `regedit.exe`
- `powershell.exe`
- `powershell_ise.exe`
- `cscript.exe`
- ...

We can try to infer if they modify the registry at their time of execution (from the process creation event `4688` to process termination event `4689`) by looking at the last write time of all registry keys (not 100% reliable as they could have been rewritten since, but better than nothing).
To help with that endeavour, we can use the command line tool from Eric Zimmerman's toolset [RECmd](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/RECmd). Example of a *partial* command:
```
RECmd.exe --StartDate "10/29/2021 15:35:01" --StoptDate “10/29/2021 15:40:00" ...
```
Note that there is also a graphical version of this tool available [Registry Explorer](https://www.sans.org/tools/registry-explorer/). Which can show those timestamps along with other interesting things such as deleted keys and disassociated keys. It also has a set of [bookmarks](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/RegistryExplorerBookmarks) to quickly go to the known registry paths useful for troubleshooting and/or investigation.  

## 👁‍🗨 What do we see in MDE?

The is a table available in Advanced Hunting in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal: `DeviceRegistryEvents`. This is populated by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

![MDE](/Images/S01E06-05.png)

It does not contain all registry modifications. It only has the one known to be potentially used by TTPs. In our macro case, since we were not doing anything fishy, MDE didn't care to log the action in this table.
Remember that if you run a query against the `DeviceRegistryEvents` and get not results, it doesn't mean that what you are looking for didn't happen. It could mean that we don't collect the data. However, if you get a match, you have a true positive.
